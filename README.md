# Car Shop Angular Project

Welcome to the Car Shop Angular project! This project consists of four main pages: Home, Car AI, Login, and Dashboard.

## Pages

### Home Page
The Home page serves as the landing page for the Car Shop application. It provides a brief overview of the services offered and encourages users to explore further.

### Car AI Page
The Car AI page is where users can input their preferences and requirements for a car. Based on this information, the AI algorithm suggests the best car options for them. The inputs are JavaScript-protected by validators to ensure accurate data submission.

### Login Page
The Login page allows users to access their accounts. Only users with the email address "admin@gmail.com" can access the Dashboard page. The login form also includes JavaScript-based validators to ensure valid input.

### Dashboard Page
The Dashboard page displays comprehensive data collected from users, including a table, graph, and map visualization.

## Features

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Users need the email address "admin@gmail.com" to access the Dashboard page. JavaScript validators are applied to the login form.
- **Data Visualization**: The Dashboard page offers intuitive data visualization tools, including tables, graphs, and maps.
- **Logout Button**: The application includes a logout button for users to securely log out of their accounts. This ensures the protection of user data and enhances security measures within the application.
